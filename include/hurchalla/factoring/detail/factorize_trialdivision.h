// factorize_trialdivision() partially (and sometimes completely)
// factorizes the number x using the first SIZE prime numbers as potential
// divisors for divisibility testing.
//
// Preconditions for factorize_trialdivision():
//   Requires x >= 2.
//
// Postconditions:
// 1) The return value is an output iterator to the position one past the last
//   factor that the function wrote to the destination range (iterated by the
//   function's parameter 'iter').  The destination range consists of all the
//   prime factors that the function was able to find for x.  This range will
//   be empty if the function could not find any factors for x and could not
//   determine whether x was prime.  The range will consist of the single
//   element x if the function determined that x was prime.
// 2) q will be set to the quotient of x divided by all the elements written to
//   the destination range (iterated by the function's parameter 'iter').  If
//   nothing was written to the range (if it's empty), then q will be set to x.
//   There are specific details that naturally follow from these facts and from
//   Postcondition 1: if q gets set to 1, then this indicates the function was
//   able to completely factor x and the destination range consists of all the
//   factors.  If q > 1, then this indicates the function was not able to
//   completely factorize x, and q represents the value still remaining to be
//   factored.  q will never be set to zero (or a value < 0).

// The function will trial a total of SIZE potential prime factors.  SIZE is a
// compile-time parameter for fine tuning of performance, that helps us to
// achieve the best possible overall performance of a factorization method in
// which this function is called.  Ideally any/all compile-time choices for SIZE
// would be guided by performance measurement tests.
//
// The function will set next_prime to the next prime larger than the last prime
// factor that it will potentially trial.  The value of next_prime is the same
// regardless of whether or not the function successfully finishes and returns
// before trialing all its potential factors.
//
// The default SIZE 54 tries all primes < 256 as potential divisors.  Thus this
// function with SIZE 54 could be used to guarantee complete factoring of any
// value x < 257*257, which includes all values of type uint16_t.

// The template-template param TTD should be either PrimeTrialDivisionWarren or
// PrimeTrialDivisionMayer.  PrimeTrialDivisionWarren is usually faster, but it
// uses around 5-10x more memory (PrimeTrialDivisionMayer typically uses around
// 2*SIZE bytes of memory).
