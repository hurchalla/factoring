// This algorithm is Wheel Factorization
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization

// Preconditions for factorize_wheel210():
//   Requires x >= 2.
// Postconditions:
//   The return value is an output iterator to the position one past the last
//   factor that the function wrote to the destination range (iterated by the
//   function's parameter 'iter').  The destination range will consist of all
//   the prime factors of x; the function will always completely factor x,
//   though it may take an extremely long time if x is large.  The destination
//   range will consist of the single element x if the function determined that
//   x was prime.
//
// factorize_wheel210 will trial all potential prime factors less than or equal
// to sqrt(x).  It may also trial a few factors that are larger than sqrt(x).

// For discussion purposes inside the function, let the theoretical constant
// R == 1 << ut_numeric_limits<T>::digits.  For example, for a type T that is
// uint16_t, R would equal 65536 and sqrtR would equal 256.

// Note: we use a struct with static functions in order to disallow ADL
