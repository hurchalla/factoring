do pathological numbers exist that fail most Pollard-Rho factoring trials (i.e.
   failing regardless of 'c' in the sequence x[i+1] = (x[i] * x[i]) + c)?

evaluate: a step to factor powers might help.
evaluate: a (potential) factorization step in miller rabin might help, but
   probably not.

MontgomeryForm - force_inline on every function?
NDEBUG defined for all release builds?

gcc montgomery pow 2 base (miller-rabin) perf at -Os, vs -O1 -O2 or -O3.
   why so slow? (inlining not happening)?
   clang doesn't have the slowdown.
   icc as I recall super-slows down at both -Os and -O1.
   Could it be my Unroll class isn't working as desired at -Os?
