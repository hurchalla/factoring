# factoring

TODO
----
Define the results for the factorization functions when x < 2.

Assuming I can remove any need factorize_wheel210 might have for it,
get rid of the "next_prime" param in factorize_trialdivision()

Find best value for HURCHALLA_ISPRIME_MAX_TRIAL_FACTOR:
The best value for HURCHALLA_ISPRIME_MAX_TRIAL_FACTOR
depends on whether the number (x) to test is very large or small.
If it's very large, for example close to UINT64_MAX, then we want
to use a somewhat large value for the macro.  If x is small, we
want to use a small value for the macro.
This is because is_prime_miller_rabin becomes slower for larger
x since it needs more witnesses.  Numbers close to uint128_max are
incredibly bad for miller rabin at the moment due to their insane
witness set - however I'm not trying to make program-wide changes
just to help optimization for uint128_t, but I'm willing to make
simple isolated changes that help it.

At the moment it appears to be fastest to set
HURCHALLA_ISPRIME_MAX_TRIAL_FACTOR to 16, essentially skipping
the is_prime_wheel.
Perhaps a replacement of the wheel with an
is_prime_small_divisions256 would make sense?
Possibly easiest way to do this is to change small_trial_division256()
to add a bool template param StopAtFirstFactor, and put the impl of 
small_trial_division256 inside a class (and use static member functions),
so as to allow partial specialization.
Or simpler, I could just use a function similar to the generic version in
smalL_trial_division256.


make miller_rabin more efficient overall, using tricks like hashing and ILP,
and using MF's pow with ILP.

Add a (potential) factorization step to miller rabin.
Add check for 1 in inner loop of miller-rabin (I suspect this may be the same TODO as the last item).
