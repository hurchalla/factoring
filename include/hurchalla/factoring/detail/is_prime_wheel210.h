// This algorithm is an adaptation of Wheel factorization, where we return false
// upon the first factor found (and set isSuccessful=true), or we return true if
// we determine that the input is prime (and set isSuccessful=true).  If we are
// unable to determine primality for the input then we set isSuccessful=false
// and return an undefined boolean value (either true or false).  Note that if
// max_factor is >= sqrt(x) (or if max_factor is defaulted) then we will always
// be able to determine primality (we will set isSuccessful=true).
// For more info see:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization
// Wheel factorization is a slight optimization (~2x) over is_prime_bruteforce()
// but it's only a constant time improvement and remains a brute force approach.
