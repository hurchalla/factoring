// This algorithm is Wheel factorization
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization
// but with testing for potential factors only up to (and including) max_factor.

// Postconditions:
// (note these are the same as for small_trial_division256())
// 1) The return value is an output iterator to the position one past the last
//   factor that the function wrote to the destination range (iterated by the
//   function's parameter 'iter').  The destination range consists of all the
//   prime factors that the function was able to find for x.  This range will
//   be empty if the function could not find any factors for x and could not
//   determine whether x was prime.  The range will consist of the single
//   element x if the function determined that x was prime.
// 2) q will be set to the quotient of x divided by all the elements written to
//   the destination range (iterated by the function's parameter 'iter').  If
//   nothing was written to the range (if it's empty), then q will be set to x.
//   There are specific details that naturally follow from these facts and from
//   Postcondition 1: if q gets set to 1, then this indicates the function was
//   able to completely factor x and the destination range consists of all the
//   factors.  If q > 1, then this indicates the function was not able to
//   completely factorize x, and q represents the value still remaining to be
//   factored.  q will never be set to zero (or a value < 0).  If max_factor
//   is defaulted or set to a value >= sqrt(x), then the function will always
//   completely factor x and set q = 1.
//
// wheel_factorization210 guarantees it will trial all potential prime factors
// less than or equal to max_factor.  It will usually also trial a few factors
// that are larger than max_factor.

// for discussion purposes inside the function, let the theoretical constant
// R == 1 << ma_numeric_limits<T>::digits.  For example, for a type T that is
// uint16_t, R would equal 65536 and sqrtR would equal 256.
