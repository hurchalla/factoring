// These 128 bases let you conduct a probabilistic primality test for any 128
// bit unsigned int number, via miller-rabin primality testing.  A test using
// these bases should work equally well for both even and odd numbers.  Note
// however that montgomery arithmetic (which is one way to implement the miller-
// rabin test) always requires odds.

// Probability Details:
// Using Miller-Rabin for large 128 bit numbers, there is no known set of bases
// to use for a deterministic test.  Instead we depend upon providing a huge
// number of bases, so that there will be an incredibly low probability that
// miller-rabin testing will ever declare that a composite number is prime after
// completing all trials.  According to
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test#Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_test
// if k is the number of bases, then the probability is  pow(4,-k)  that all
// trials will declare that a particular composite number is prime (it never
// declares a prime is composite).  So with 64 bases, if we tested every number
// from 1 to (1<<128), we might expect very roughly about 1 false declaration of
// prime.  With an additional 64 bases (for a total of 128), the probability
// that this single expected false declaration would still remain would be very
// roughly 1/(1<<128), or 1 chance in 340282366920938463463374607431768211456.
// See the Wikipedia link's discussion of the conditional probability and Bayes'
// theorem for some info on why I wouldn't be surprised if the true probability
// is 100x more likely.  Yet even assuming it's 100000 times more likely, it
// would have odds of 1 in a decillion (roughly one over the number of grains of
// sand on earth, squared) that any number exists between 1 and (1<<128) for
// which it would deliver a wrong answer.

// see MillerRabinBases.h for why this template uses a DUMMY parameter.
