// factorize_trialdivision() partially (and sometimes completely)
// factorizes the number x using the first SIZE or size_limit (whichever is
// smaller) prime numbers as potential divisors for divisibility testing.
//
// Preconditions for factorize_trialdivision():
//   Requires x >= 2.
//
// Postconditions:
// (note these are the same as for factorize_wheel210())
// 1) The return value is an output iterator to the position one past the last
//   factor that the function wrote to the destination range (iterated by the
//   function's parameter 'iter').  The destination range consists of all the
//   prime factors that the function was able to find for x.  This range will
//   be empty if the function could not find any factors for x and could not
//   determine whether x was prime.  The range will consist of the single
//   element x if the function determined that x was prime.
// 2) q will be set to the quotient of x divided by all the elements written to
//   the destination range (iterated by the function's parameter 'iter').  If
//   nothing was written to the range (if it's empty), then q will be set to x.
//   There are specific details that naturally follow from these facts and from
//   Postcondition 1: if q gets set to 1, then this indicates the function was
//   able to completely factor x and the destination range consists of all the
//   factors.  If q > 1, then this indicates the function was not able to
//   completely factorize x, and q represents the value still remaining to be
//   factored.  q will never be set to zero (or a value < 0).

// The function will trial a total of either SIZE or size_limit potential prime
// factors, whichever is smaller.  SIZE is a compile-time parameter for fine
// tuning of performance, that helps us to achieve the best possible overall
// performance of a factorization method in which this function is called.
// Likewise, size_limit is a run-time parameter intended for fine tuning, given
// a particular number to factor.  The idea behind size_limit is that when
// factoring smaller numbers it *might* improve performance to use size_limit
// to stop trial division before trialing all SIZE primes.  Ideally any/all
// compile-time and run-time choices for SIZE and size_limit would be guided by
// performance measurement tests.
//
// If the function does not completely factorize x, it will copy into next_prime
// the next prime larger than the last prime factor that it trialed.  For some
// factorization methods you may want/need to know the next prime that wasn't
// yet trialed in order to continue factoring, while for others methods (e.g
// pollard-rho) it's irrelevant.  The value of next_prime is unspecified if the
// function completely factors x.
//
// The default SIZE 54 tries all primes < 256 as potential divisors (unless
// size_limit < SIZE).  Thus this function with SIZE 54 could be used to
// guarantee complete factoring of any value x < 257*257, which includes all
// values of type uint16_t.

// The template-template param TTD should be either PrimeTrialDivisionWarren or
// PrimeTrialDivisionMayer.  PrimeTrialDivisionWarren is usually faster, but it
// uses around 5-10x more memory (PrimeTrialDivisionMayer typically uses around
// 2*SIZE bytes of memory).
