// This is the API for factorization.
//
// The API consists of two functions which both return all factors of the
// argument value.  The only difference between the two functions is the
// structure used for the factors: the first function uses an array, and the
// second uses a vector.  See the comments above each function for more details.

// ------------------------------------
// The Algorithms:
// ------------------------------------
// Prior to heavier-weight factorization, factorize() first uses a small trial
// disivion stage.  It then uses either ECM or Pollard-Rho to find all remaining
// factors, depending on the size of the number.  Prior to trying to extract
// any factor with ECM or Pollard-Rho, it tests for primality by using the
// deterministic Miller-Rabin algorithm - internally this algorithm is usually
// sped up by using one of the very small hash tables (~100 bytes for example)
// in factoring/include/hurchalla/factoring/detail/miller_rabin_bases/
//
// For numbers below ~40 bits, factorize() uses the Pollard-Rho factorization
// algorithm, with Brent's improvements (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm)
// along with other further improvements I made to the algorithm.
//
// For numbers above ~40 bits, factorize() uses ECM tailored for numbers between
// 32 to 128 bits in size.  This ECM code was initially based on Ben Buhrow's
// "micro-ecm", which was then improved, optimized, and extended to 128 bits.

// ------------------------------------
// Performance:
// ------------------------------------
// For 64 bit numbers, the factorization functions above are likely the fastest
// available anywhere at the time of this writing, both for factoring arbitrary
// values and for factoring semiprimes with two large factors.
//
// For 128 bit numbers, this code needs to be performance tested against other
// factoring libraries.  An initial expectation is that this code will be
// be competitive or possibly do better than other libraries available for 128
// bit numbers, but this is not yet known.
//
// For 32 bit numbers, a very well-optimized implementation of Hart's One Line
// Factoring algorithm and/or Lehman's method might potentially be faster than
// the functions in this file.  Nevertheless the functions here should be fairly
// close to the fastest currently available at 32 bits.
//
// For 256 bit or larger numbers - which this library does not support - you may
// wish to seek out ECM for smaller bit depths, and then Quadratic Sieve and
// GNFS for larger bit depths.  For example, see the GMP project/library.


// ------------------------------------
// The functions:
// ------------------------------------

// Returns a std::array that contains all factors of x, and writes the total
// number of factors to num_factors.  The array entries with index < num_factor
// are the factors.
// The argument 'expect_arbitrary_size_factors' does not affect the results, but
// it will optimize the factoring to be faster when you know or expect all the
// factors will be large (assuming you set it to false), or it will optimize the
// factoring for arbitrary size factors (if set to true, which is the default).
//
// Note that ut_numeric_limits is a utility class that is used here to
// automatically get the bit width of your type T.  For example, if your type T
// is uint32_t, then this function returns std::array<uint32_t, 32>.  (The bit
// width has significance because it is impossible to have more factors than
// type T's bit width.)
// T can be any integral type <= 128 bits.

    // After calling this function, a client should not index the returned
    // array with an index >= num_factors.  As a defensive measure, we'll set

// This version of factorize takes a std::vector, which it clears of any

// Note that this version might be preferable to the array version of factorize
// if you wish to save stack space; vector is heap allocated but the array
// version needs memory on the stack for its returned array (for example with
// type T of uint64_t, the array needs 512 bytes on stack).
